# Go Example

Go Example is golang examples from many project with golang. I love golang, that why i created this repository to collect all golang project examples.

I hope this repository can help someone who has an interest with golang ðŸ˜€.

**Cryptography** plays a crucial role in securing digital data. It involves encoding information into an undecipherable form, making it safe even if it falls into the wrong hands. The rightful owner possesses the decryption key to retrieve the original information.

In the context of **Go (Golang)**, the standard library provides robust support for cryptography and hashing. Here are some key points about cryptography in Go:

1. **Go Cryptography Libraries**:

   - The root package for cryptography in Go is `crypto`, which includes various sub-packages like `aes`, `cipher`, `sha`, and `rsa`.
   - Additionally, there's a package called `hash` that provides a common interface for hash functions such as MD5, SHA256, and HMAC.

2. **Basic Principles of Cryptography**:

   - **Data Confidentiality**: Ensures that data remains private and hidden from unauthorized access.
   - **Data Integrity**: Guarantees that data remains unaltered during transmission.
   - **Data Availability**: Ensures data is accessible when needed.
   - **Access Control**: Manages who can access specific data.

3. **Common Cryptographic Algorithms**:

   - **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**: A block cipher technique where plaintext is processed in 16-byte blocks. Each block is encrypted separately using a 32-bit key.
   - **DES (Data Encryption Standard)**: An older symmetric-key algorithm.
   - **RSA (Rivestâ€“Shamirâ€“Adleman)**: Asymmetric encryption for secure communication and digital signatures.

4. **Go's Crypto Library Usage**:
   - Developers can invoke functions from the Go crypto library to implement cryptographic algorithms.
   - For example, AES encryption can be achieved using the AES functions provided by the library.

Remember that while encryption can be broken, it remains a valuable mechanism for ensuring data security and privacy. If you're interested in exploring practical examples and diving deeper into Go's `x/crypto` package, you can refer to resources like [this guide](https://reintech.io/blog/a-guide-to-gos-xcrypto-package-advanced-cryptography) or explore the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/golang-collection/Go-cryptography) dedicated to Go cryptography.
